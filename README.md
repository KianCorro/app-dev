# **Overview**

The Fate series is a TYPE-MOON media collective that follows various events called Holy Grail Wars that involve Masters, generally accomplished magi, summoning Servants, Heroic Spirits, and battling each other until the last remaining pair can claim the purported Holy Grail. It began with the visual novelWP, Fate/stay night, and has since gathered a number of prequels, sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations bearing the same "Fate" name.
